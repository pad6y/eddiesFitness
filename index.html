            pieces of the ‘fitness jigsaw’ together - the physiological
            training, healthy nutrition and strong sport psychology as a base,
            then putting everything into practice during 1:1 training sessions.
            <br />

            <h2>Physiological training plan</h2>
            <p>
              This is essential for the person centred way in which I work.
              Everyone’s fitness abilities are different so it’s about tuning
              into the individual, assessing their capabilities and designing a
              plan that maximises their potential and helps achieve fitness
              goals in a structured, disciplined and progressive way, usually
              though a mixture of cardiovascular and weight training exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
              If fitness is not followed in a structured and proper way then the
              whole purpose will be defeated. It’s important individuals have
              the correct lifting weights, are working on a specific area of
              their body each training day, are completing the right amount of
              sets/reps, are having days off at the right time (when they should
              complete appropriate stretching exercises), and that the
              cardiovascular exercise is at the right intensity (often run/walk
              intervals are a good starting point for this).
            </p>

            <p>
              My training plan typically covers an initial 15 week period split
              into three 5 week sections which gradually become increasingly
              more challenging to improve the individual and always look to push
              them out of their comfort zone.

            <h2>Nutrition plan</h2>
            <p>
              You can’t outrun a bad diet! There is no point having an effective
              physiological training plan without an effective nutrition plan to
              compliment it.
            </p>
            <p>
              My nutrition plans cover 4 weeks and includes the 4 meals of the
              day, snack ideas and recommendations for portion sizes. They take
              account of individual preferences, I always ask the customer to
              let me know foods they DON’T like so that I leave these out of the
              4 week plan.
            </p>
            <p>
              The nutrition plans include the perfect mix of carbohydrates,
              protein and healthy fats. Some of the meal combinations may look a
              little strange/complicated but I always advise that customers give
              them the benefit of the doubt, most are pleasantly surprised! And
              all the recipes are on Google and NOT as complicated as they seem!
            </p>
            <p>
              As with all aspects of sport science, I closely monitor the very
              latest in healthy nutrition to compliment a structured training
              plan, trying to ensure that nutrition is fun, varied and above all
              else tasty!

            <h2>Sport psychology support</h2>
            <p>
              This is my favourite sport science principle and an area I studied
              in great depth at university and I continue to keep abreast of
              developments in this field.
            </p>
            <p>
              My sport psychology support consists of a meeting with each
              individual customer to get an idea of how I can help them with
              this aspect. Following on from this is 3-4 weeks of sport
              psychology support techniques/mindset changes done over text/email
              followed by another meeting with the customer to assess how they
              felt the support had been for them and if any aspect of their
              sport psychology support requires further explanation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Training and nutrition is nothing if the mind isn’t in the right
              place for exercise so this is another essential part of the
              fitness jigsaw.

              within this field.

              summer holidays. The class is fun as well as teaching great
              technique. Eddie makes the classes engaging and enjoyable for all
              ages and abilities and is really encouraging. My son really looks
              forward to the class and wishes they lasted longer. Would really
              recommend the bootcamp as something different to try in the next
              school break.

              I have been attending Eddie's Outdoor Bootcamp on Saturday
              mornings since October. They are really enjoyable and I began to
              feel the benefits quite soon after starting - both physically and
              mentally. I feel really alive after each session. Eddie is
              encouraging and helpful and he creates a very supportive
              environment. I whole-heartedly recommend his sessions.

              As part of the package I got from Eddie, I got a personalised
              training plan along with a personalised nutrition plan, tailored
              around several intolerances I have! Both were easy to follow. I
              also used Eddie's personal training services. He provides great
              motivation throughout the sessions and good feedback afterwards.
              Would 100% recommend!
